# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Customer-Reviews

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of sentiment analysis on customer reviews using pretrained models. The primary objective of this project is to web scrape customer reviews and identify the most effective model for classifying these reviews into positive and negative categories. By analyzing sentiment, this project aims to uncover valuable insights from customer feedback, which can significantly inform and enhance business decision-making processes.

## Project Overview

The core features of this project include:
- Web scraping of customer reviews from the Zalando website.
- Loading and preprocessing of the scraped reviews from a CSV file.
- Sentiment classification using multiple pretrained models such as:
  - **RoBERTa** (`siebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english`)
  - **Cardiff NLP RoBERTa** (`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`)
  - **DistilBERT** (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`)
  - **DeBERTa** (`yangheng/deberta-v3-large-absa-v1.1`)
- Comparative evaluation of model performance based on key metrics.
- Data visualization to illustrate the sentiment distribution and inter-model correlations.
- Aspect-based sentiment analysis focusing on specific aspects like service, price, and quality.
- Interactive Data Analysis with Streamlit and PandasAI: An additional feature that allows users to upload CSV files and interactively analyze data using natural language prompts. This feature leverages LangChain with Ollama's `mistral` model for natural language processing.

## Project Structure

- `Benchmark_Sentiment_Analysis_models.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook delves into the benchmarking of various sentiment analysis models to determine the most effective one for classifying a small set (475 reviews) scraped of customer reviews, as positive or negative. It emphasizes the systematic evaluation of key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to provide a comprehensive understanding of each model's capabilities. In addition to these metrics, the notebook includes an analysis of the distribution scores of the models, offering insights into how each model's predictions align with the actual sentiment labels.
- `Sentiment_Analysis_Zolando_reviews.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to conducting sentiment analysis using the top-performing model from our benchmark, the RoBERTa model, on a substantial dataset of 1,958 customer reviews scraped from the Zalando website. By leveraging the RoBERTa model's capabilities, the notebook not only classifies the reviews into positive and negative sentiments but also provides a comprehensive examination of the resulting data, highlighting trends and patterns that can inform business strategies.
- - `streamlit_app.py`: The main Streamlit application file that enables users to upload CSV files and interactively analyze them using PandasAI. Key functionalities include data visualization generation based on user prompts, using LangChain and Ollamaâ€™s `mistral` model.
- `README.md`: Documentation outlining project details (this file).

## Streamlit App for Interactive Data Analysis

This project includes an interactive data analysis tool using Streamlit, LangChain, and PandasAI. Users can upload a CSV file and prompt the app for specific data analysis tasks such as row counts or column distributions. This feature uses LangChain's integration with Ollama's `mistral` model to process natural language commands and generate visualizations based on the input.

### How to Use the App

1. Run the Streamlit app using:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py

2. Upload a CSV file when prompted.
3. Enter your natural language query (e.g., "How many rows?" or "Plot distribution of column X").
4. Click on "Generate" to see the analysis output and any visualizations.
